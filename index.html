      content="Code, coffee, and more code â˜•ðŸ’». That's basically me. Iâ€™m a frontend engineer with 3 years of experience, a passion for React, and a habit of diving headfirst into Javascript projects. Backend with Node.js? Sure, I can sprinkle some of that in too. When Iâ€™m not building with Javascript or hacking away in Node.js, Iâ€™m probably writing about it or creating npm packages just for fun. Let's connectâ€”who knows, we might just refactor some bugs together!"
